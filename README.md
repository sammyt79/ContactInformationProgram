# ContactInformationProgram
Java2 week3

This was my second individual assignment for JAVA PROGRAMMING II.

Here were the requirements for the assignment:

Part 1
Design, implement, test, and debug a program with a JFrame that allows the user to enter 
a series of contactsâ€™ names, ages, e-mail addresses, and cell phone numbers, and creates a file from the entered data. 
Validate the age entry to ensure that it is numeric and between 0 and 120. Include information for three to five contacts.

Part 2
Design, implement, test, and debug a program that reads the file you created by the list in Part 1 
and displays the records in a JFrame. You may either display all entries in the list at once 
or display them one at a time; the user interface is up to you. Protect against not being able to open the file.

To run the program
